DC/OS Vagrant
==================

Quickly provision a DC/OS cluster on a local machine for development, testing, or demonstration.

Deploying dcos-vagrant involves creating a local cluster of VirtualBox VMs using the [dcos-vagrant-box](https://github.com/dcos/dcos-vagrant-box) base image and then installing [DC/OS](https://dcos.io/).

**Issue tracking is moving to the [DCOS JIRA](https://dcosjira.atlassian.net/) ([dcos-vagrant component](https://dcosjira.atlassian.net/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20DCOS%20AND%20component%20%3D%20dcos-vagrant)).
Issues on Github will be disabled soon.**

# Deploy

1. Install & Configure Vagrant & VirtualBox

    This repo assumes Vagrant and VirtualBox are installed and configured to work together.

    See the [Architecture docs](./docs/architecture.md) for details about the DC/OS Vagrant cluster architecture.

1. Clone This Repo

    Select where you want the dcos-vagrant repo to be on your local hard drive and `cd` into it. Then clone the repo using git.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/dcos/dcos-vagrant
    ```

    To upgrade to a new version of dcos-vagrant:

    1. Change into the repo directory (e.g. `cd ~/workspace/dcos-vagrant`)
    1. Fetch the new code (e.g. `git fetch`)
    1. Checkout the new desired version (e.g. `git checkout v0.6.0`)

1. Configure VirtualBox Networking

    Configure the host-only `vboxnet0` network to use the 192.168.65.0/24 subnet.
    
    1. Create the `vboxnet0` network if it does not exist:
    
        ```bash
        VBoxManage list hostonlyifs | grep vboxnet0 -q || VBoxManage hostonlyif create
        ```

    1. Set the `vboxnet0` subnet:

        ```
        VBoxManage hostonlyif ipconfig vboxnet0 --ip 192.168.65.1
        ```

1. Install Vagrant Host Manager Plugin

    The [Host Manager Plugin](https://github.com/smdahlen/vagrant-hostmanager) manages the `/etc/hosts` on the VMs and host to allow access by hostname.

    ```bash
    vagrant plugin install vagrant-hostmanager
    ```

    This will update `/etc/hosts` every time VMs are created or destroyed.

    To avoid entering your password on `vagrant up` & `vagrant destroy` you may enable [passwordless sudo](https://github.com/smdahlen/vagrant-hostmanager#passwordless-sudo).

    On some versions of Mac OS X, installing vagrant plugins may require [installing a modern version of Ruby](./docs/install-ruby.md).

1. Download the DC/OS Installer

    If you don't already have a DC/OS Installer downloaded, you'll need to select and download one of the [supported versions](#supported-dcos-versions).

    Once downloaded, move `dcos_generate_config.sh` to the root of the repo (the repo will be mounted into the vagrant machines as `/vagrant`).

    If you have multiple `dcos_generate_config.sh` files downloaded you can name them differently and specify which to use with `DCOS_GENERATE_CONFIG_PATH` (e.g. `export DCOS_GENERATE_CONFIG_PATH=dcos_generate_config-1.5-EA.sh`).

    Enterprise edition installers are also supported. Contact your sales representative or <sales@mesosphere.com> to obtain right DC/OS installer.

1. <a name="configure-the-dcos-installer"></a>Configure the DC/OS Installer

   Select a config file template based on the downloaded version of DC/OS (select one):

   - DC/OS 1.7: `export DCOS_CONFIG_PATH=etc/config-1.7.yaml`
   - DC/OS 1.6: `export DCOS_CONFIG_PATH=etc/config-1.6.yaml`
   - DC/OS 1.5: `export DCOS_CONFIG_PATH=etc/config-1.5.yaml`

   The path to the config file is relative to the repo dir, because the repo dir will be mounted as `/vagrant` within each VM.
   Alternate configurations may be added to the `<repo>/etc/` dir and configured in a similar manner.

   Alternatively, a URL to an online config can be specified (e.g. `export DCOS_CONFIG_PATH=http://example.com/config.yaml`).

1. Configure the DC/OS Machine Types

    Copy the example VagrantConfig file:

    ```bash
    cd <repo>
    cp VagrantConfig.yaml.example VagrantConfig.yaml
    ```
    
    See [Configure](#configure) for more details on customizing your cluster.

1. (Optional) Download/Update the VM Base Image

    By default, Vagrant should automatically download the latest VM Base Image (virtualbox box) when you run `vagrant up <machines>`, but downloading the image takes a while the first time. You may want to trigger the download or update manually.

    ```
    vagrant box add https://downloads.dcos.io/dcos-vagrant/metadata.json
    ```

    If you already have the latest version downloaded, the above command will fail.

    **Known Issue**: Vagrant's box downloader is [known to be slow](https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant/issues/5319). If your download is super slow (100-300k/s range), then cancelling the download (Ctrl+C) and restarting it *sometimes* makes it download faster.

1. (Optional) Configure Other Options

   DC/OS Vagrant supports many other [configurable options via environment variables](#environment-options). Skip these for first time use.

1. Deploy DC/OS

   Specify which machines to deploy. For example (requires 5.5GB free memory):

   ```bash
   vagrant up m1 a1 p1 boot
   ```

   Many permutations of machines are possible. See [Example Clusters](#example-clusters) for more options.

   Once the the machines are created and provisioned, DC/OS will be installed. Once complete, the Web Interface will be available at <http://m1.dcos/>.

   See the [DC/OS Usage docs](https://dcos.io/docs/latest/usage/) for more information on how to use you new DC/OS cluster.

1. (Optional) Authentication

   When installing the Enterprise Edition of DC/OS (>= 1.6) on dcos-vagrant, the cluster will prompt for a username and password when using the DC/OS CLI or the web dashboard.

   If you're using the provided 1.6 or 1.7 installer config file then the superuser credentials are by default `admin`/`admin`.


# Configure

The number of machines and their resources is configurable, depending on your needs and hardware constraints.

The [VagrantConfig.yaml.example](VagrantConfig.yaml.example) includes some preset machine configurations that have been chosen to allow the widest possible use cases within a constrained memory environment (e.g. a laptop with 16GB memory). These presets may or may not fit your use case. If they don't, just modify your `VagrantConfig.yaml` file to fit your needs.

Deploying multiple VMs takes a lot of memory and Mesos reserves more for overhead on each node. So don't expect to be able to install every DC/OS service or use production-grade configurations. Most services will require reduced configurations in order to fit within the allocated memory. Some services (e.g. Cassandra) may require more nodes/resources than others.

For more information about how the DC/OS installation works and how to debug deployment/installation failure, see [DC/OS Installation](./docs/dcos-installation.md).

## Node Types

Each machine in `VagrantConfig.yaml` must specify one of the following node types that governs how that machine will be provisioned:

- `master` - Master node that runs the DC/OS core components (e.g. `m1`)
- `agent-private` - Agent node that runs the Mesos agent with the `*` role (e.g. `a1`)
- `agent-public` - Agent node that runs the Mesos agent with the `slave_public` role (e.g. `p1`)
- `boot` - Bootstrap node that runs the installer (e.g. `boot`)

## Cluster Constraints

Which exact machines are created and provisioned can be specified in one of two ways:

1. Specify the machines by name when deploying (e.g. `vagrant up m1 a1 p1 boot`)
1. Remove the unwanted machines from the `VagrantConfig.yaml` file and deploy them all with `vagrant up`

Generally option 1 is recommended to avoid having to modify the `VagrantConfig.yaml` file.

When selecting which machines to deploy, the following constraints must be observed:

- An odd number of master nodes is required (usually 1, 3, or 5)
- Any number of public and/or private agent nodes is allowed
- Exactly one bootstrap node is required
- The bootstrap node must be provisioned last

## Resource Constraints

Mesos agent nodes are where DC/OS services will be installed. Mesos will auto-detect the amount of resources available on these machines, with the following constraint:

- Mesos reserves half or 1 GB of each machine's memory for overhead (whichever is least)

For example, `m1` has 3328 MB memory by default. Some of that memory will be taken by OS and DC/OS component processes (~ MB). 1 GB will be reserved by Mesos as overhead. The rest will be offered to Mesos frameworks for launching tasks (~ MB).

**IMPORTANT**: Make sure your local machine has enough memory to launch all your desired VMs, otherwise your machine may lock up as all the memory is consumed.


# Example Clusters

Any permutation of machines that fits the above constraints is possible. Below are a few options to try.

## Minimal Cluster

A minimal cluster supports launching small Marathon apps. Most other services will fail to install, because they require more than one agent node.

Requires > 4.5GB free memory (using the example [VagrantConfig](./VagrantConfig.yaml.example)).

```bash
vagrant up m1 a1 boot
```

## Small Cluster

A small cluster supports running tasks on multiple nodes.

Requires > 7.25GB free memory (using the example [VagrantConfig](./VagrantConfig.yaml.example)).

```bash
vagrant up m1 a1 a2 p1 boot
```

## Medium Cluster

A medium cluster supports the installation of a [minimally configured Cassandra](./examples/oinker#install-cassandra).

Requires > 10GB free memory (using the example [VagrantConfig](./VagrantConfig.yaml.example)).

```bash
vagrant up m1 a1 a2 a3 a4 p1 boot
```

## Large Cluster

Requires > 17GB free memory (using the example [VagrantConfig](./VagrantConfig.yaml.example)).

A large cluster supports master node fail over, multiple framework installs, and multiple public load balancers.

```bash
vagrant up m1 m2 m3 a1 a2 a3 a4 a5 a6 p1 p2 p3 boot
```


# Environment Options

There are several configurable options when deploying a cluster and installing DC/OS on it. Most of them are configurable via environment variables:

- `DCOS_BOX` - VirtualBox box image name (default: `mesosphere/dcos-centos-virtualbox`)
- `DCOS_BOX_URL` - VirtualBox box image url or vagrant-cloud style image repo (default: `https://downloads.dcos.io/dcos-vagrant/metadata.json`)
- `DCOS_BOX_VERSION` - VirtualBox box image version (default: `~> 0.5.0`)
- `DCOS_MACHINE_CONFIG_PATH` - Path to virtual machine configuration manifest (default: `VagrantConfig.yaml`)
    - Must contain at least one `boot` type machine, one `master` type machine, and one `agent` or `agent-public` type machine.
- `DCOS_CONFIG_PATH` - Path to DC/OS configuration template (default: `etc/config.yaml`)
    - `master_list`, `agent_list`, `exhibitor_zk_hosts`, and `bootstrap_url` will be overridden.
- `DCOS_GENERATE_CONFIG_PATH` - Path to DC/OS configuration generation script (default: `dcos_generate_config.sh`)
- `DCOS_INSTALL_METHOD` - One of the following [installation methods](./docs/alternate-install-methods.md) (default: `ssh_pull`):
    - `ssh_pull` - Use the "manual" DC/OS installation method (`dcos_install.sh`) with a pool of thread workers performing remote SHH installation.
    - `ssh_push` - Use the "automated" DC/OS installation method (`dcos_generate_config.sh --deploy`). WARNING: Does not (yet) support agent-public nodes!
    - `web` - Use the GUI DC/OS installation method (`dcos_generate_config.sh --web`). WARNING: Does not (yet) support agent-public nodes!
- `DCOS_JAVA_ENABLED` - Boolean to install java on each agent (default: `false`)
- `DCOS_PRIVATE_REGISTRY` - Boolean to install an insecure private Docker registry on the boot machine and configure the agents to allow it (default: `false`)

Additional advanced configuration may be possible by modifying the Vagrantfile directly, but is not encouraged because the internal APIs may change at any time.
